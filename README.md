## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### **Prerequisites** :

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### **Starting React Dev Server** :

1. Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2. Navigate to the My-Portfolio folder.

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3. In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type below command.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This creates a **node_modules** folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.

4. In the same command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should then run successfully and you should see a message like **" VITE v4.x.x ready in xxx ms Local: http://localhost:5173/"**.

5. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.
